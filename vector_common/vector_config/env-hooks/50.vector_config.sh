# This configures the environment variables for a vector robot in simulation and real hardware.
# This is necessary to run before starting the simulation or the platform. Change this path
# depending on where you decided to save the top level directory. You need to completely clean the workspace
# (ie delete dev, build and install directories leaving src) and recompile.
